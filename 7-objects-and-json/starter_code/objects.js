var some_pet;

// Answer Starts Here

// Answer Ends Here

// 3. Create a constructor function for Pet objects, as described above. The constructor function should be responseible for setting
//    the values of `name`, `species`, `breed`, and `noise`. The constructor function should also give each pet a method called `makeNoise`,
//    which behaves as described in Q3.

var Pet;
