## Ice Breaker
Write the directions to making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on the table in front of you.

## Disclaimer

Note:

Disclaimer - This class will not be heavy in traditional computer science (theory,
history, etc); we are primarily concerned with the practical. We want you to be able
to write programs in JavaScript. Today is an exception to that rule -- in order to
build context, I am going to delve a bit into history, but it will be
fun I promise!

### The Language of the Web

--

### ARPANET
<img src="img/darpa.jpg" style="max-height: 500px" />

- Research Project funded by government agency DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)
- First connection in 1969
- Used for sending information: email, files
- Connected military bases and research universities

--

<img src="img/arpanet.png" style="max-height: 600px" />

- Over time, more people added to the net: large business, smaller universities, etc
- Other, smaller nets based on similar tech also began to emerge
- These networks were connected to ARPANET, creating an "inter" net.

### _Sir_ Tim Berners-Lee
<img src="img/bernerslee.jpg" style="max-height: 500px" />

- 1989 - 1990 Drafted the proposal for the WWW
- He wanted a way to link the information in the disparate CERN
computers

### High-Performance Computing and Communications Act of 1991
<img src="img/mosaic.jpg" style="max-height: 500px" />

- Browser created with grant money from the bill, drafted by Al Gore.
- This is when the internet began to take off outside of government/academia

--

### Al Gore

--

<img src="img/netscape.png" style="max-height: 500px" />

- Marc Andreesen and other key employees left Mosaic to start Netscape

--

### Brendan Eich
<img src="img/brendan.jpg" style="max-height: 500px" />

- Debate within Netscape about whether or not the browser needed a new Language
- Netscape had a big deal in the works with Sun Microsystems, creator of Java
- Created "LiveScript" in 10 days

--

## +

<img src="img/java.jpg" style="max-height: 200px" />

- Eich was told the language needed to "look like" java
- His primary inspiration came from a functional, mostly academic language called
Scheme
- This led to JavaScript being able to use both of the two primary programming
paradigms: Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming

--

### Object Oriented Programming
<img src="img/java.jpg" style="max-height: 200px" />

- Everything is an Object
- Objects have attributes and methods

--

<img src="img/oop.png" style="max-height: 600px" />

--

### Functional Programming
<img src="img/scheme.jpg" style="max-height: 200px" />

- Everything is a function
- Mathematical
- Comes from a type of math called Lambda Calculus, hence the symbol in Scheme's
logo

--

<img src="img/fp.png" style="max-height: 600px" />

- To do interesting things, we combine and compose functions

--

<img src="img/javascript.png" style="max-height: 500px" />

- Name was changed to JS because of the deal with Sun Microsystems; primarily
a marketing/branding decision

--

### ECMAScript

- Standard for the language to formalize what JavaScript was in 1996
- Needed because more browsers were being created with different implementations
of JavaScript
- Rivals, Java for the browser, ActionScript, Flash existed, but fell off and
never reached the popularity of JavaScript

##How The Internet Works
<img src="img/how_internet_works.png"  />

<img src="img/Client-server-model.png">

--

###Intro To HTML

* HyperText Markup Language
* Been around since the early 90's
* Started as a way for researchers to use and share documents and first version had 18 tags
* Gives meaning (and a little visual structure) to content
* Not a programming langage

--

##Intro To CSS

* Cascading Style Sheets
* Been around since the mid 90's
* Handles all of the visual aspects to a webpage and removed the need for HTML to handle this
* Made up of a series of centralized rules that can override each other
* Not a programming language

--

##Intro To JavaScript

* Adds behavior to webpages and applications
* Been around since the mid 90's
* C & Java inspired syntax, and is a prototype based language with first class functions
* Is not related to the Java server side language
* Is the only real programming language available for the browser
### Awesome Modern JavaScript Uses
