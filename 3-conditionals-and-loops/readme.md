## Class 3: Conditionals and Loops

### Goals
* Use if/else conditionals to control program flow based on Boolean (true or false) tests.
* Use Boolean logic (!, &&, ||) to combine and manipulate conditional tests.
* Use switch/case conditionals to control program flow based on matching explicit values.
* Differentiate among true, false, 'truth*y', and 'false-y'.
* Review loop iteration using for and forEach, and introduce while and do/while loops.
